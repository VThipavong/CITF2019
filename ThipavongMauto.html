<h1>Yzma's Diabolical Plan</h1>
<p>He can’t get rid of me that easily.
        Who does that ungrateful
        little worm think he is? Does he…
        have any idea of
        who he’s dealing with?
        How could he do this to me?
        Why, I practically raised him.
        That’s it!
        I’ll get rid of Kuzco.
        Don’t you see?
        It’s perfect.
        With him out of the way
        and no heir to the throne…
        I’ll take over and rule the empire.
        Ah, how shall I do it?
        Oh, I know.
        I’ll turn him into a flea,
        a harmless little flea…
        and then I’ll put that flea in a box
        and then I’ll put that box
        inside of another box..
        and then I’ll mail that box
        to myself, and when it arrives…
        I’ll smash it with a hammer!
        It’s brilliant, brilliant, brilliant,
        I tell you! Genius, I say!
        Or, to save on postage,
        I’ll just poison him with this.</p>

<p>Is that my voice? Is that my voice? Oh, well.
        - No, no! Don't drop it! 
        -I'm not going to drop it, you fool!I'm going to drink it!And once I turn back into my beautiful self... I'm going to kill you!Oh! Uh-oh.</p>
